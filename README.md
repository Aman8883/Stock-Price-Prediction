# Stock-Price-Prediction
# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project aims to predict future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a type of recurrent neural network architecture. LSTM networks are particularly well-suited for sequence prediction problems, making them a popular choice for stock price forecasting.

## Features

- Load and preprocess historical stock price data
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Build and train an LSTM model for stock price prediction
- Evaluate the model's performance on the test set
- Visualize the actual and predicted stock prices

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (or other deep learning library)
- yfinance
- talib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install the required Python packages:
 ## Usage

1. Obtain historical stock price data and save it in a CSV file (e.g., `stock_data.csv`).

2. Update the `load_data` function in `model.py` to load your stock data file.

3. Run the `train.py` script to train the LSTM model:

4. After training, you can use the `predict.py` script to make predictions on new data:
  
  This will load the trained model and make predictions on the test set. You can modify the script to make predictions on custom data as well.
